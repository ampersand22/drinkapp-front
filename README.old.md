# drinkapp-front

Two databases were made in django, one with users and one with drinks.
Sara and Lexi made the posts and search bar, while Alex and Jey made nav, login components.

We put the main app together on Day 1 and started bug testing throughout the week.

Pip install bcrypt was used in Django to encrypt passwords.
